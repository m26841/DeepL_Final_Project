## Problem Statement
Income data is important for several reasons. On a national scale, it is one of the primary indicators of a nation's economic well being. Census income data also determines the allocation of resources for government-funded programs, such as food distribution and job training programs for following years. Investigating trends in income data can also lead to better understanding of income inequality, and spur the development of mitigation measures. In the United States, an income of 50K a year put an individual at 400% of the federal poverty line and a family of 4 at the 150% mark. 

In order to better understand and predict markers of income, we decided to develop a network that will predict whether or not an individual makes above or below 50K a year based on a variety of factors, including location, age, gender and race. We also aim to examine the impact of individual factors on income.
